[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/dwyl/chat](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/dwyl/chat/?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)\n\n### Create a `.env` File\n\nWe use (*and recommend*) `.env` files for environment configuration.  \nWe call our file `.env` for *cross-project consistency*.  \n(*but you can call your file what ever you like e.g*: `.env`)  \n\nA `.env` file is a very explicit way of listing environment variables\nwithout the extra syntax (_potential human/input error_) of a JSON file.\nIt also allows for easier copy-pasting into the terminal\n(with an `export` keyword prepended to each line).\n\nThe format of a `.env` file is:\n\n```sh\nexport DB_HOST=127.0.0.1\nexport DB_PORT=9200\nexport DB_USER=anon\nexport DB_PASS=password\n```\n\n> Note the **lack of _spaces_**. You may leave blank lines and insert comments\n(starting with '#') to organise the file if you wish. Follow the **instructions\nbelow** for placing it in your `.gitignore` file.\n\n### *Alternatively* Create an `env.json` Configuration File\n\nIf you *prefer* to use `.json` instead of `.env` create a `config.json` file in your repo with the following format:\n\n```js\n{\n  \"DB_HOST\": \"127.0.0.1\",\n  \"DB_PORT\": 9200,\n  \"DB_USER\": \"anon\",\n  \"DB_PASS\": \"password\"\n}\n```\n\n### *Always* `.gitignore` your configuration file\n\n***Always*** create your `.env` or `env.json` file\nin the ***root directory*** of your project and _don't forget_ to add it to your `.gitignore`to\navoid _accidentally_ committing your keys/passwords to GitHub where bad people can (*will*) steal your secrets!\n\ne.g:\n```sh\necho '.env' >> .gitignore\n```\n***or***\n```sh\necho 'env.json' >> .gitignore\n```\n\n\n### Install from NPM\n\nNext **install** `env2` from npm and save it to your `package.json` file:\n\n```sh\nnpm install env2 --save\n```\n\n### Use in your Code\n\nThen in your script/module:\n\n```js\nconst env = require('env2')('./path-to-your/.env');\n\n// your app goes here\nconsole.log(process.env.DB_HOST); // \"127.0.0.1\"\n```\n\nnow all the entries in your `env.json` or `.env` file are available as\nkeys/values of the `process.env` Object which means you can use\n`process.env.API_KEY` or `process.env.DB_PASSWORD` in your script.\n(*or what ever you have defined as entries in your* `env.json`)\n\n\nEnv is synchronous; it loads all your configuration variables into the\n`process.env` object *before* app/script execution.\n\n<br />\n\n## Do you want to Define Priority for Variables?\n\nDo you want the ability to *specify* the priority which\nenvironment variables take precendence?  \ne.g: if you supply a command-line argument when running your script/app:\n```sh\nenv=PROD API_KEY=token.dwyl.yolo node myapp.js\n```\nWe have an *open discussion* on this: https://github.com/dwyl/env2/issues/1\n\nAt present, any environment variable defined in the environment where\nyour app is running (or via command-line arguments) will take\nprecendence over the same key in your `env.json` file ... if you prefer\nto have the option to *specify* the priority, please add a comment to the isssue:\nhttps://github.com/dwyl/env2/issues/1\n\n\n<br />\n## Huh?\n\n[The Twelve Factor App](http://12factor.net/config) section 3 states:\n\n> \"**Store config in the environment**\"\n\n\"*An app’s config is everything that is likely to vary between deploys\n(staging, production, developer environments, etc)*\".\n\n<br />\n\n## Name ?\n<small>\n**Q**: Why is it called \"env2\"?  \n**A**: as the digit in the name suggests, there was/is an \"env\" (version 1):\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/env written by [@dshaw](https://github.com/dshaw)\nsadly, it was never finished and has not been updated in 4 years ...\nWe asked Dan if he would accept a Pull Request updating the package:\nhttps://github.com/dshaw/env/issues/6 and he said he *would* accept it ...\nBut after investing the time and submitting the pull request:\nhttps://github.com/dshaw/env/pull/8 which updated the package to the latest\nversion of Node/io.js and had tests with 100% coverage, the PR got ignored.\nsee: https://twitter.com/dshaw/status/628237150253772801\nNot that we're \"_impatient_\" but we need to move on with our code/lives.\nThat's why we wrote **env2**.\n\nWe have since added better error handling and alternative file types,\nso **env2** is can be considered the \"***New & Improved Version***\"\n</small>\n",
